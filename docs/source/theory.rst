Theory
======

For the theory behind group convolutions, we recommend `the original paper on group convolutions by Taco Cohen and Max Welling <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/cohenc16.html>`_
and the book, lectures and notebooks on the geometric deep learning by Michael Bronstein, Joan Bruna, Taco Cohen and Petar Veličković,
found `here <https://geometricdeeplearning.com>`_.

For an explanation in my own words and a step by step implementation from scratch of an early version of GroCo,
see this `Colab notebook <https://githubtocolab.com/APJansen/GroCo/blob/main/notebooks/GroupConv_intro.ipynb>`_.
