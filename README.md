# GroupConv
Work in progress, to be continued after vacation :)

Exploring group convolutions, and implementing them as Keras layers.

Based on the original paper by Taco Cohen and Max Welling, and also heavily based on the book, lectures and notebooks on the geommetric deep learning 
by Micheal Bronstein, Joan Bruna, Taco Cohen and Petar Veličković, found here. All credit goes to them, and all mistakes are my own.
